Named resum_cv, where you can see my professional resume. 

In this project can pratice about the use of templates in the django framework, exercting concepts like DRY – don’t repeat yourself, through the use for templantes extesion, and partials. Here I could see when is more apropriated to use base.html and partials.

Here we used: .env and .ignore files, and like use urls.py file for organize all the apps urls, and yet, we used onde postreSql base for ,manteince the data. comand for have the dependeces for the virtual envirioment listed in the requiriments.txt file.

NOTE: All the statict files and css were created by https://startbootstrap.co
